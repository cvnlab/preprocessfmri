preprocessfmri is a set of MATLAB scripts for pre-processing fMRI data (including 
slice time correction, motion correction, and spatial undistortion based on fieldmap
measurements).  It is developed by Kendrick Kay (kendrick@post.harvard.edu, 
http://kendrickkay.net).

The main novelty of the code lies in the handling of the fieldmaps (including
using local linear regression to smooth the fieldmaps and the ability to 
interpolate fieldmap measurements smoothly over time).  The code is powerful 
and has many features but may therefore be somewhat complicated to apply.

The code has several dependencies:
- SPM (for motion correction routines)
- FSL (for the "prelude" utility)
- ba_interp3 (included in the "external" folder)
- NIFTI_20110215 (included in the "external" folder)
- knkutils (see http://github.com/kendrickkay/knkutils)

Notes:
- The code is incompatible with newer versions of the NIFTI toolbox.
- You may have to mex ba_interp3 for your own platform (try "which ba_interp3 -all").

Contents:
- preprocessfmri.m - The main function.  Instead of calling this function directly,
                     you probably want to write a script that makes the call easier.
- preprocessfmri_standardscript.m - A template script that calls preprocessfmri.m
- preprocessfmri_CNIscript.m - A template script that calls preprocessfmri.m
- README - The file you are reading
- utilities - A directory containing various utility functions
- external - External toolboxes included for your convenience
